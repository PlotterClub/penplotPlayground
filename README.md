# Penplot Playground

[![experimental](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/experimental.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

This is a set of utilities that [@danisaza](https://github.com/danisaza) and I built on top of Matt Deslaurier's incredible [penplot](https://github.com/mattdesl/penplot) library.

This code got some recent interest at an art show, so we're uploading it in hopes that others will play around with it.

The repository features tools for working with [l-systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system). You'll also find example code for using these, including an implementation of the P3 Penrose Tiling.

Check out the penplot repo on @mattdesl's github for details on how to run the code and save the output as an SVG.

If you own an AxiDraw v3, you can print these SVGs using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/). [@danisaza](https://github.com/danisaza) wrote a line de-duplication utility, which drastically reduces the plotting time.

## Watch It Go

Watch a plotter machine [draw the P3 Penrose Tiling](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bfp0hATFzfm/?taken-by=dannysaza), and read [@danisaza](https://github.com/danisaza)'s description of the tiling and the system used to generate it.

Then, [check out how much faster the plotter is](https://www.instagram.com/p/BgS4MkeDEt0/?taken-by=dannysaza) when line de-duplication is performed.
